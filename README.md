# Î» (lambda)
Experimental game engine research project with a focus on exploring different approaches to already solved problems.

## Current focus
- Research weird and novel ways of doing common game engine tasks
- Thread as much as possible
- C++ 20 modules for everything
- Avoid hierarchies as much as possible (make C-like flat code)
- Don't put too much effort into big architecture, instead focus on small reusable code

## Notes
I already have a working 3D game engine I've developed casually over some years that uses SDL and Vulkan (Winodws, Linux, Steam Deck, MacOS, iOS, and Android). It is written in pure C code and so were the games/apps that came out of it. As an excuse to mess around with C++20 modules and also explore experimental concepts in game engine development I decided to make this repository. I'll likely be pulling over a lot of the Vulkan boiler plate code I have from that engine to get things running at some point. For now I'm going to be putting up some test code to get the module structure started on both Windows and Linux.

# Reasoning
I've been a programmer in-industry for over a decade now with a focus on game engines, networking, and multi-threaded code. Now I'm going to school to officially get my degree in mathematics, and I have a strong desire to take a serious look at what I know about writing game engines and graphics libraries. For the most part it is long-term industry knowledge/experiance I've picked up over time. However, I find myself questioning, what if there are strange/creative ways to solve the same problems that have already been solved by game engines. That is where this repository comes in, to explore those questions. So we'll see how this goes...
