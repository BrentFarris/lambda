# Î» (lambda)
Experimental game engine research project with a focus on exploring different approaches to already solved problems.

## Current focus
- Research weird and novel ways of doing common game engine tasks
- Thread as much as possible
- C++ 20 modules for everything
- Avoid hierarchies as much as possible (make C-like flat code)
- Don't put too much effort into big architecture, instead focus on small reusable code
